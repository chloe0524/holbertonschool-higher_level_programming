# Python - Inheritance
## Tasks
### 0. Lookup
Write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object.

### 1. My list
Write a class `MyList` that inherits from `list` and implements a method to print the list sorted.

### 2. Exact same object
Write a function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class; otherwise False.

### 3. Same class or inherit from
Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class; otherwise False.

### 4. Only sub class of
Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class; otherwise False.

### 5. Geometry module
Write an empty class `BaseGeometry`.

### 6. Improve Geometry
Write a class `BaseGeometry` with a method `area()` that raises an Exception indicating it's not implemented.

### 7. Integer validator
Write a class `BaseGeometry` with a method `integer_validator()` that validates if a value is an integer and greater than 0.

### 8. Rectangle
Write a class `Rectangle` that inherits from `BaseGeometry` with private width and height attributes.

### 9. Full rectangle
Write a class `Rectangle` that inherits from `BaseGeometry` with private width and height attributes and implements the `area()` method.

### 10. Square #1
Write a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle` with private size attribute and implements the `area()` method.

### 11. Square #2
Write a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle` with private size attribute, implements the `area()` method, and provides custom string representation.
